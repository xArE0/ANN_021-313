# Perceptron-based ANN 

This project implements a simple Artificial Neural Network using the **Perceptron learning algorithm** from scratch in Python using **NumPy only**. It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the inner workings of a binary classifier using a step activation function.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Binary classification using the Perceptron model
- Step activation (threshold) function
- Customizable learning rate, threshold, and training epochs
- Minimal external dependencies (only NumPy)

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Overview

The Perceptron learns by adjusting weights based on the prediction error using the formula:

w = w + Î± * error * input

Where:
- `w` is the weight
- `Î±` is the learning rate
- `error = actual - predicted`

The process continues until either the error becomes zero or the maximum number of epochs is reached.
